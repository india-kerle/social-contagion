# Network Analysis - Social Contagion

### Are victims of cheaters more likely to cheat?

A Final project for my computer programming class. Only fundamental Python types permitted. Explored video game data and the incidence of cheating. 

Simulated 10 different network universes in which an individual who was killed by a cheater then went on to kill. Results provide evidence that victims of cheaters are not more likely to cheat.
